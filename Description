AIM:


To assist a pharmaceutical company find the best state(s) to market their new prescription,that aid aliens blend in with humans.
The focus being on investigating alien hostility, alien age, and their diet.


METHODOLOGY:
The data set was downloaded from Ian K's 'Aliens in America' challenge advertisment on LinkedIn.
The three CSVs( Aliens in America- Location, Aliens in America- Details, Aliens in America- aliens) were downloaded and converted into Excel workbooks
(Xslx files)
The three workbooks were imported into Microsoft SQL Server (64 bit version)



Data was explored and analyzed in this order:
1. Data exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploartory Data Analysis
4. Using SQL queries to obtain information from all three workbooks
5. Queries such as left joins, LIKE, NOT, GETDATE,SUM etc was used
6. Exportation of the SQL queries into Tableau for data visualization


VIZUALIZATIONS:
Tableau was used to create a dashboard to visualize the data
Images for an ' Alien background' was downloaded from Google Images

CONCLUSION:


1.Wyoming is the least alien- aggressive state ,therefore barriers to market-entry could possible be minimal for prescription marketing


2. Texas is the most aggressive state,followed by California. Aggressive-reduction anticonvulsants/ antidepressants is a feasible  prescription target market


3. Age-reduction tablets should be marketed to all states ,as all states have ages that are above the average American life-expectancy of 76.7 years(Times, 2019)


4. Based on diets(without Feeding frequency)
Market syynthetic Chicken, Beef supplements to have more ' human-like' food within their diet


5. Texas and California are also attractive markets for appetite-inducing stimulants. This is to encourage daily eating,which is a common diet eating frequency for humans
